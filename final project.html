  <h1>final project</h1>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to look over my final project for this semester. I went over CSS basics, the importance of using HTML, and how to recognize the three different styles. This course taught me a lot. I had heard of the terms discussed in this session previously, but I didn't really comprehend them until I learned them here. I will undoubtedly utilize what I have learned in my daily life and assist others in becoming more Good with technology.</p>
