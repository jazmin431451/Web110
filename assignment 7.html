 <p>In this session, we'll look at networking and how it's done. As a result, networks with diverse hardware and software implementations were incompatible, making communication between networks with different specifications problematic. The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) investigated different network methods to address this problem of network incompatibility and their inability to connect with one another. After that, they realized they needed to design a network model that would aid suppliers in creating interoperable network implementations. It is mostly used to specify how communication between devices should take place. One of the key benefits of the reference model is that it establishes standards for network building components, allowing for multi-vendor development. Reference models specify which functions should be executed at each tier of the model, resulting in uniformity. The OSI reference model and the TCP/IP reference model are the two most essential reference models. Many people utilize computer networks, and they are spread out all over the world. This approach was designed by ISO (International Organization of Standardization) to secure national and international data communication. A model for open system interconnection (OSI) is commonly referred to as an OSI model. There are seven layers in the model architecture. In a comprehensive communication system, it defines seven tiers or levels. These seven strata are all linked to one another. Another chapter delves into the OSI Reference Model in greater depth. An Internet protocol (IP) permits a person to communicate information over the internet; you'll need the correct address - just like you would if you were mailing a traditional letter. It is, however, the IP address in this scenario. Data packets receive an IP address in the same way that a letter receives a stamp to ensure it reaches the intended recipient. An IP address differs from a postal address in that it does not correspond to a physical place; rather, it is issued to networked devices automatically or manually during connection setup. In this process, the "Internet Protocol" is crucial.</p>
