    <h1>assigment 8</h1>

    <p>In session eight is about security how to make the internet safe. Internet safety refers to the act of being safe when surfing the web. This involves being aware of the risks associated with your online activity and putting in place a few measures to reduce or eliminate these risks. The terms "online safety," "cyber safety," and "e-safety" are all used to refer to internet security. You must also understand how to create a strong password. The first step in password security is to create a strong password. A strong password must have at least 12 characters, but 14 or more is better. There are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals, and symbols. It's not a term from a dictionary, and it's not the name of a person, character, product, or organization. It's not the same as any other password you've used before. The safest way to shop online is to choose well-known websites. Start by going to a trustworthy website. It's possible that search results have been tampered with to lead you astray, especially if you're looking for anything specific. Find the lock. Never use your credit card to make an online purchase from a site that lacks SSL (secure sockets). Don't share too much information. No online store demands your Social Security number or birthday to access their website. This information should not be shared with anyone. One approach to detect infections is to turn off your Windows machine. Restart your computer by pressing the F8 key repeatedly. To confirm the "Clean up system files," select "Yes" when requested. Click "OK" once your computer has finished deleting the temporary Internet files. After the malware scanning program has been downloaded, run it. Best Practices for Secure Browsing Several behaviors should be adopted to improve the security of your online activities. While the following list may sound onerous, most of these recommendations are simple to adopt and can significantly improve your online security.</p>
