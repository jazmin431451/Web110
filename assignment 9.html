    <h1>assigment 9</h1>
    <p>In session 9 is about HTML documents that use the Microsoft Indexing Service and contain code that dictates how database results should be shown on a Web page, which is often prepared with Microsoft FrontPage Web development software. Web browsers employ the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) as the core programming language to render pages on the internet. A user can use Hypertext to click a link and be redirected to a new page that the link refers to. Web 1.0 was a static version of HTML, but newer versions have a lot more dynamic flexibility (Web 2.0, 3.0). HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for texts that are intended to be viewed on a web browser. Technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and programming languages like JavaScript can help. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or locally stored files and convert them to multimedia web pages. This is a very common misinterpretation. HTML originally featured cues for the document's look and described the structure of a web page logically. HTML elements are the components that make up HTML pages. Images and other objects, such as interactive forms, can be embedded in the produced page using HTML techniques. HTML allows you to create organized documents by indicating structural semantics for text elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, links, quotations, and other elements. Tags are used to separate HTML elements, and angle brackets are used to write them. "image" is an example of a tag. Other tags, such as <p>and, offer information about the document's text and may comprise sub-elements of other tags. The HTML tags are not displayed by browsers, but they are used to read the page's content. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the most common Web page construction technologies.</p>
