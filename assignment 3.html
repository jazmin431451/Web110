    <h1>assigment 3</h1>

    <p>This assignment's learning is based on the use of search engines. One of the most critical digital literacy skills you may have is the ability to search for information available on the internet. The search engines allow you to quickly find what youâ€™re looking for without having to sift through a page of irrelevant results.  Google is a multinational public corporation; it develops and hosts internet-based services and products. Google is one of the biggest search engines on the internet and it processes a billion searches by locating the main content. This is usually the most relevant part of the page. On most pages, it's easy to find, although... Make sure you're on the right webpage. If you don't see any relevant information, use the navigation bar, or search box. If you're looking for information, the Internet has a lot of it. The problem is you can't trust every website you find. You'll need to evaluate each website to decide whether it's reliable. People mainly use Google, but I prefer Bing since I can obtain more results than what I'm looking for. Google, the most widely used search engine on the planet, has an excellent feature that makes it the greatest search engine available. Furthermore, Google has a market share of over 92 percent in most of the world's top GDP countries. In addition, as of 2021, its parent firm Alphabet was one of the world's largest online corporations, with a market valuation of 1,392 billion U.S. dollars. The lowest market share is YAHOO! which is 3.23 percent. According to Bing vs. Google statistics, the most important differentiators are keywords, backlinks, and social media presence. Because it permits keyword stuffing, the Bing technique may appear antiquated. Because SEO has grown into a more complicated and strategic subject, employing the core keyword several times will not bring you the desired first-page ranking. Furthermore, Bing pays insufficient attention to backlinks, even though the category is critical for Google's SERP.</p>
