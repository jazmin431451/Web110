<p>In session JavaScript is an interpreted, lightweight programming language. It is intended for the development of network-centric applications. It works in tandem with and complements Java. Because JavaScript is interwoven with HTML, it is incredibly simple to use. It's free to use and cross-platform. This language is more than just a replacement for CoffeeHandwriting; it's the ideal programming language for beginners to get started with right away, as well as a great starting point for any future developments. It's completely future-proof, as it's used by practically everyone on the internet. Knowing simply one coding language is sufficient nowadays, but most professions require you to code in multiple languages. JavaScript is a strong contender for the first one, not just for the reasons stated above, but also because it serves as an excellent introduction to any future programming languages you might want to learn. The advantages of JavaScript are excellent on their own, but any aspiring programmer should realize that studying JavaScript first is a good bet. In Career Foundry, Stevens states, "JavaScript gives an essential introduction to key principles and practices that you'll take with you throughout your career as a developer." JavaScript, like C++, Python, and Java, offers object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming approaches. That means that when you're finished with JavaScript and want to learn the next language, you'll be able to do so much faster than usual. Many languages steal concepts from one another or are designed to compensate for one another's flaws. JavaScript is one of the few programming languages that has totally transferrable skills that can help you get up and running quickly when learning another language. Why should you learn JavaScript? Because it will assist you in learning Python or C++. Change the DOM, for example, and the HTML displayed in the browser will change. The benefit is that we can access and edit any element of the DOM, and hence part of the HTML, regardless of where our JavaScript is located. The only thing to remember about the relative location of the HTML we want to edit and the JavaScript that will change it is that when the JavaScript code tries to access it, the HTML has already been loaded and parsed by the browser. This can be accomplished by placing the JavaScript code after the HTML (or loading the JavaScript after the HTML), or by telling the JavaScript to load after the HTML (if the JavaScript is loaded before the HTML). </p>
