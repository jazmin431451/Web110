<h1>assigment 11</h1>
<p>This project is about raster graphics, commonly known as bitmaps, which use fixed pixels to hold image data. These pixels, each of which represents a single hue, are arranged in a grid (or a "raster" proper, which is where the name comes from). When you take a step back, all those colored pixels come together to make a clear image, much like a mosaic. Graphic design graphics with higher resolutions require more colors, which necessitates more pixels, which necessitates more storage. The amount of pixels in an image file, rather than the image's dimensions, determines its size: a screen-sized low-definition image has less data than an Ultra-HD profile photo. High-resolution photographs include smaller pixels, resulting in a higher pixel density â€” a measurement known as DPI or PPI, which stands for "Dots Per Inch" or "Pixels Per Inch," respectively. (The two terms can be used interchangeably.) Raster pictures with a high DPI have fewer pixels, allowing for more colors to be displayed in the same amount of area. High definition images have a resolution of 300 DPI or above, whereas standard-definition photos have a resolution of 72 DPI or less. Keep in mind, however, that when uploading these images to the web, browsers only examine the final size, not the DPI. Pixel exists for a reason. Start with a high DPI image if you want a high-resolution hero image background that covers your entire screen. Vector graphics, on the other hand, are not constrained by DPI, which is why they're ideal for web design - as we'll discuss further below. It's a common misconception that all web photos are automatically lowered to 72 DPI, however, this is untrue. It dates from a time when screen displays were not as advanced as they are now. Image compression, or the process of shrinking image files while maintaining as much quality as feasible, is made possible by the number of pixels used and how they are organized. The movie below demonstrates the power of pixel imaging at lower resolutions. GIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor that can be used for image alteration (retouching), picture editing, free-form sketching, image transcoding, and other specialized activities.I will definitely be applying learned material in my everyday life and helping others to become more Internet literate.</p>
