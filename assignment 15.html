  <h1>Career Planning</h1>    
  <p>As I begin to investigate potential jobs, we'll discuss the necessity of assessing your career needs, evaluating your skills and personality, considering my financial needs, and acquiring job skills. I'm taking the time to learn more about myself since it can help me make better job decisions. As you pursue a profession, knowing what you genuinely need and value will help you achieve a better sense of purpose and direction. Finding out more about my talents and interests will help me discover a job that meets my needs and feels good. Coding is something I enjoy doing. I've been repairing computers and selling them on eBay since I was a youngster. I do. I'm interested in learning more about computers and programming. This course was an excellent opportunity for me to discover new subjects that I was previously unaware of. I was familiar with HTML, but I had never used Visual COD before, so knowing how to use it was helpful. It will be really beneficial to my career. I self-taught myself by going to the library and learning about computers and coding.</p>

  <h2>Job Outlook and Preparation</h2>
  <p>Finding my first job out of college can be daunting, especially if my talents and qualifications lead me to a field with large organizations and a large number of bright individuals. The trick is to avoid limiting oneself to extremely particular entry-level jobs. I can discover a job that is a good fit for me and will help me on my journey to success if I grasp the various occupations available in various industries. I was debating whether or not web developers and digital designers would be a good fit for me. I am already proficient in Python, C++, and HTML, CSS, and Clojure.</p>

  <h3>my final project</h3>
  <p>CSS is the topic I chose for my final project. I'll explain how CSS is the presentation layer and the second language in front-end web page development. I'll go over how to use the three different styles: external, internal, and inline. I'll also have images of the HTML file and the fundamental elements to use to format the web page, as well as basic elements, tags to add and how to change the HTML element's property and value.</p>
