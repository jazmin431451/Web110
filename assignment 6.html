 <p>Internet Information Services (IIS, formerly Internet Information Server) is an extensible web server software built by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family of operating systems. HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP, and NNTP are all supported by IIS. Email, Skype, Twitter, instant messaging, and videoconferencing are just few of the services available via the Internet. Among the key services supplied by the Internet are the World Wide Web and fast access to information. E-commerce, e-learning, e-health, and Internet banking are some of the other essential Internet services. The Internet has become a basic requirement for living, working, engaging with others, and communicating with them. Individuals can become a part of the global globe by using the services provided by the Internet. Email and other Internet-based communication technologies allow for easy, low-cost, and simultaneous communication among numerous people from all over the world. Collaboration on various tasks, such as schoolwork, has improved thanks to customized mailing lists and bulletin boards for groups of users. Furthermore, the Internet allows users to share a shared folder or files. This helps to ensure that projects are completed on time. Companies can use the Internet to develop websites and blogs to share information about their activities with the rest of the world. Many institutional libraries have used the Internet to improve their patrons' access to information. In many libraries, for example, replacing the manual catalogue with an electronic catalogue has boosted efficiency in the search for books and periodicals. The use of cutting-edge Internet services in industries such as health, education, commerce, banking, and sports has improved service delivery efficiency. People can interact with friends and the rest of the world through social networking sites like Facebook. Finally, folks can use their free time to play online games with others who are online. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is an acronym for Voice over Internet Protocol. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a method of transmitting voice over the Internet. IP Telephony, Internet Telephony, and Internet Calling are all terms used to describe this technology. Using a normal phone line instead of VoIP can be a more cost-effective option. Local, long-distance, and even international phone calls are all possible with some VoIP providers. Your speech is converted into a digital signal that travels over the internet using VoIP technology. VoIP converts this signal into a standard phone signal before it reaches its destination. This allows a VoIP user to communicate with a traditional phone user. A VoIP solution is made up of several software components. Most VoIP solutions come with user interface software. Users can use this software to handle system hardware and send messages to the screen. To function, every VoIP software requires standard networking components. A TCP/IP network stack, DHCP client software, and the Domain Name System are among them (DNS). A VoIP signaling protocol stack is also required. SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol and is a widely used open standard.</p>
