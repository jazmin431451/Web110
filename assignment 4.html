    <p>Assignment 4 is about knowing more about emails. Email is the most common form of communication in the business world. Some professionals get hundreds or even thousands of emails a day. They're busy people and so, to capture the interest of your recipient, you should write a clear and informative self-introduction. Emails are about writing to another person. Although you should introduce yourself, make sure to write about the other person. Although you should introduce yourself by stating your name and position near the beginning of the email, your opening paragraph should focus on the recipient. You will be more likely to capture their interest if you open with a compliment. You could mention something specific about their work that you like or that you admire about their organization. Beginning with a mutual interest is a good way to engage someone, such as attending the same school or growing up in the same area. Also, using the subject line of an email is the first thing a recipient will see and will likely affect their decision of whether to open and read the email. You should write a subject line that is professional, informative, and brief. Also, if you want to exchange the email with more than one person, it is better to add their names in a BCC. Also, another thing you can do with email is to use it for school and contact your family via video conference. But, you must be careful when opening any email because it could have spam. There is a way to block this, so you don't have a virus. There is a way to block spam email senders. After you open the app in your web browser, it takes only minutes to block potential spam email senders. The spam collector option creates a straightforward way to filter your emails. Spam is an email that rarely provides useful information and is sent to advertise products that don't interest you. Also, many are malicious and are used to scam you out of your money or personal information. It's like hacking your computer without knowing that you are being hacked.</p>
