    <p>In Session 10 is about CSS. (cascading style sheets). CSS specifies how HTML elements should appear on a screen, in print, or in other media. CSS helps you save time and effort. It has the ability to control the layout of numerous web pages at the same time. CSS files contain external stylesheets. CSS is also used to establish styles for your web pages, such as design, layout, and display variations for various devices and screen sizes. CodeAcademy has helped me gain a better understanding of HTML. It's not the same as learning on my own. It was beneficial to learn visual coding in this manner, as well as other new things. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a simple design language that is used to create web pages. You can use CSS to change the color of the text, the font style, the spacing between paragraphs, the size and layout of columns, the background pictures or colors used, layout designs, differences in display for different devices and screen sizes, and a variety of other effects. Become a web designer by following these steps: HTML and CSS design are required abilities if you wish to pursue a career as a professional web designer. Web-based control: CSS is simple to learn and understand, but it gives you a lot of power over how an HTML document looks. CSS is frequently used in conjunction with the markup languages HTML or XHTML. Learn other languages: Once you understand the basics of HTML and CSS, other related technologies like JavaScript, PHP, or Angular become easier to understand. CSS can be added to HTML by linking to a separate stylesheet file, importing files from existing stylesheets, embedding CSS in a style tag, or adding inline styles directly to HTML elements. Many of these methods can also be done with Javascript. Today we're going to explore the pros and cons of each CSS method, see how they work, and learn when to use each one. We'll cover how to: link to a stylesheet file; embed CSS with a style tag; add inline styles to HTML elements; import a stylesheet file; and how to inject CSS with JavaScript. We'll also go through some of the most often asked questions by developers when it comes to using CSS in HTML documents: How to minify CSS to make your website load faster; and To optimize website rendering time, learn how to inline above-the-fold CSS. A style tag can be used to insert CSS rules directly into HTML pages. The type property, like the link element, can be removed in HTML5, and the media value determines when your styles are applied (leave it off to default to all devices). Between the opening and closing style tags, add your CSS rules and write your CSS the same way you would in a standalone stylesheet file. Because CSS rules are render-blocking, it's best to put style tags in the HTML document's head so they may download as quickly as possible. We'll talk about render-blocking CSS later.</p>
